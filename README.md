# Sonifier


### What is it?

This Shiny app is a final project in **Developing Data Products** course on
**Coursera.org** platform. 

It's not really much about data itself. It takes your name as an input and
sonify it. It basically assigns frequencies to letters and generates a sequence
of sound based on these frequencies. 

### Input

The app allows to control 2 parametes:
* Text, that will be sonified
* Type of signal to be generated
